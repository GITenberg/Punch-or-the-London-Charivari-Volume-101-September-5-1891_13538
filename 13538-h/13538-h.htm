    <h2>SOME CIRCULAR NOTES.</h2>

    <h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

    <h4><i>Reims&mdash;Night&mdash;Streets&mdash;Arrival&mdash;Lion
    d'Or&mdash;Depression&mdash;Landlady&mdash;Boots&mdash;Cathedral&mdash;Loneliness&mdash;Bed.</i></h4>

    <p>It is just ten o'clock. Reims seems to be in bed and fast
    asleep, except for the presence in the streets of a very few
    persons, official and unofficial, of whom the former are
    evidently on the alert as to the movements, slouching and
    uncertain, of the latter.</p>

    <p>We drive under ancient Roman Arch; DAUBINET tells me its
    history in a vague kind of way, breaking off suddenly to say
    that I shall see it to-morrow, when, so he evidently wishes me
    to infer, the Roman Arch will speak for itself. Then we drive
    past a desolate-looking Museum. I believe it is a Museum,
    though DAUBINET's information is a trifle uncertain on this
    point.</p>

    <p>We pass a theatre, brilliantly illuminated. I see posters on
    the wall advertising the performance. A gendarme, in full
    uniform, as if he had come out after playing <i>Sergeant
    Lupy</i> in <i>Robert Macaire</i>, is pensively airing himself
    under the <i>façade</i>, but there is no one else within
    sight,&mdash;no one; not a <i>cocher</i> with whom <i>Sergeant
    Lupy</i> can chat, nor even a <i>gamin</i> to be ordered off;
    and though, from one point of view, this exterior desolation
    may argue well for the business the theatre is doing, yet, as
    there is no logical certainty that the people, who do not
    appear outside a show, should therefore necessarily be inside
    it, the temple of the Drama may, after all, be as empty as was
    <i>Mr. Crummles</i>' Theatre, when somebody, looking through a
    hole in the curtain, announced, in a state of great excitement,
    the advent of another boy to the pit.</p>

    <p>And now we rattle over the stones joltingly, along a fairly
    well-lighted street. All the shops fast asleep, with their
    eyelids closed, that is, their shutters up, all except one
    establishment, garishly lighted and of defiantly rakish,
    appearance, with the words <i>Café Chantant</i> written up in
    jets of gas; and within this <i>Café</i>, as we jolt along, I
    espy a <i>dame du comptoir</i>, a weary waiter, and two or
    three second-class, flashy-looking customers, drinking,
    smoking, perhaps arguing, at all events, gesticulating, which,
    with the low-class Frenchmen, comes to much the same thing in
    the end, the end probably being their expulsion from the
    drinking-saloon. Where is the <i>chantant</i> portion of the
    <i>café</i>? I cannot see,&mdash;perhaps in some inner recess.
    With this flash of brilliancy, all sign of life in Reims
    disappears. We drive on, jolted and rattled over the cobble
    stones&mdash;(if not cobble, what are they? Wobble?)&mdash;and
    so up to the <i>Lion d'Or</i>.</p>

        <a href="images/109-1.png"><img width="100%"

    </div>

    <p>I am depressed. I can't help it. It <i>is</i> depressing to
    be the only prisoners in a black van; I should have said
    "passengers," but the sombre character of the omnibus suggests
    "Black Maria;" it <i>is</i> depressing (I repeat to myself), to
    be the only two passengers driving through a dead town at
    night-time, as if we were the very personification of "the dead
    of night" being taken out in a hearse to the nearest cemetery.
    Even DAUBINET feels it, for he is silent, except when he tries
    to rouse himself by exclaiming "Caramba!" Only twice does he
    make the attempt, and then, meeting with no response from me,
    he collapses. Nor does it relieve depression to be set down in
    a solemn courtyard, lighted by a solitary gas-lamp. This in
    itself would be quite sufficient to make a weary traveller
    melancholy, without the tolling of a gruesome bell to announce
    our arrival. This dispiriting sound seems to affect nobody in
    the house, except a lengthy young man in a desperate state of
    unwakefulness, who sleepily resents our arrival in the midst of
    his first slumber (he must have gone to bed at nine), and
    drowsily expresses a wish to be informed (for he will not take
    the trouble to examine into the matter for himself) whether we
    have any luggage; and this sense of depression becomes
    aggravated and intensified when no genial Boniface (as the
    landlord used invariably to be styled in romances of half a
    century ago) comes forth to greet us with a hearty welcome, and
    no buxom smiling hostess, is there to order the trim
    waiting-maid, with polished candlestick, "to show the gentleman
    his room." And, at length, when a hostess, amiable but
    shivering, does appear, there is still an absence of all
    geniality; no questions are asked as to what we might like to
    take in the way of refreshment, there is no fire to cheer us,
    no warm drinks are suggested, no apparent probability of
    getting food or liquor, even if we wanted it, which, thank
    Heaven, we don't, not having recovered from the last
    hurriedly-swallowed meal at the railway buffet <i>en route</i>.
    Yes, at the "Lion d'Or" at Reims, on this occasion, <i>hic et
    nunc</i>, is a combination of melancholy circumstances which
    would have delighted <i>Mark Tapley</i>, and, as far as I know,
    <i>Mark Tapley</i> only.</p>

    <p>"On an occasion like this," I murmur to myself, having no
    one else to whom I can murmur it confidentially,&mdash;for
    DAUBINET, having a knowledge of the house, has disappeared down
    some mysterious passage in order to examine and choose our
    rooms,&mdash;"there is, indeed, some merit in being jolly."</p>

    <p>DAUBINET returns. He has found the rooms. The somnolent
    boots will carry our things upstairs. Which of the two rooms
    will I have? They are <i>en suite</i>. I make no choice. It is,
    I protest, a matter of perfect indifference to me; but one room
    being infinitely superior to the other, I select it,
    apologetically. DAUBINET, being more of a <i>Mark Tapley</i>
    than I am, is quite satisfied with the arrangement, and has
    almost entirely recovered his wonted high spirits.</p>

    <p>"Very good. <i>Très bien!</i> Da! Petzikoff! Pedadjoi! I
    shall sleep like a top. <i>Bon soir! Buono notte! Karascho!</i>
    Blass the Prince of WAILES!" and he has disappeared into his
    bedroom. I never knew a man so quick in unpacking, getting into
    bed, and going to sleep. He hasn't far to go, or else Morpheus
    must have caught him up, <i>en route</i>, and hypnotised him. I
    hear him singing and humming for two minutes; I hear him
    calling out to me, "All right? Are you all right?" and, once
    again invoking the spirit of <i>Mark Tapley</i>, I throw all
    the joviality I can into my reply as I say, through the wall,
    "Quite, thanks. Jolly! Good-night!" But my reply is wasted on
    him; he has turned a deaf ear to me, the other being on the
    pillow, and gives no sign. If he is asleep, the suddenness of
    the collapse is almost alarming. Once again I address him. No
    answer. I continue my unpacking. All my portmanteau
    arrangements seem to have become unaccountably complicated. I
    pause and look round. Cheerless. The room is bare and lofty,
    the bed is small, the window is large, and the one solitary
    <i>bougie</i> sheds a gloom around which makes unpacking a
    difficulty. I pull up the blind. A lovely moonlight night. In
    front of me, as if it had had the politeness to put itself out
    of the way to walk up here, and pay me a visit, stands the
    Cathedral, that is&mdash;some of it; but what I can see of it,
    <i>au clair de la lune</i>, fascinates me. It is company, it is
    friendly. But it is chilly all the same, and the sooner I close
    the window and retire the better. Usual difficulty, of course,
    in closing French window. After a violent struggle, it is done.
    The bed looks chilly, and I feel sure that that stuffed,
    pillow-like thing, which is to do duty for blanket and
    coverlet, can't be warm enough.</p>

    <p>Hark! a gentle snore. A very gentle one. It is the first
    time I ever knew a snore exercise a soothing effect on the
    listener. This is decidedly soporific. It is an invitation to
    sleep. I accept. The Cathedral clock sounds a <i>carillon</i>.
    It plays half a tune, too, as if this was all it had learnt up
    to the present, or perhaps to intimate that there is more where
    that comes from, only I must wait for to-morrow, and be
    contented with this instalment. I am. Half a tune is better
    than no tune at all, or <i>vice versâ</i>: it doesn't matter.
    When the tune breaks off I murmur to myself, "To be continued
    in our next;" and so&mdash;as I believe, for I remember nothing
    after this&mdash;I doze off to sleep on this my first night in
    the ancient town of Reims.</p>

    <h2>BUMBLE BROUGHT TO BOOK.</h2>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>["Mr. Ritchie ... has taken the unusual step of
        preparing a memorandum explanatory of ... the Public Health
        (London) Act, which comes into operation on the 1st of
        January ... The Vestries and District Councils ... have
        come out with increased powers, but also with increased
        responsibilities. They are in future known as 'the sanitary
        authorities'; they must make bye-laws, and enforce not only
        their own, but those made by the County Council; and, if
        they fail in their duty&mdash;as, for example, in the
        matter of removing house-refuse, or keeping the streets
        clean&mdash;they are liable to a fine. It is pleasant to

    appearance of this official, who will not fail to turn up, you
    will now appeal to one of your three female assistants, the
    middle-aged one for choice. Placing your case, as it were, in
    her hands, she will, in a half-sympathetic, half-commanding
    tone, address the official somewhat as follows:&mdash;"This
    gentleman, who is travelling to Barminster, and is going
    third-class (she makes a point of this), is, as you see, a
    great invalid, and he will require (this with a certain sense
    of being understood to mean a handsome tip) a carriage to
    himself." If said with a certain self-assurance, involving a
    species of lofty wink, this will probably be understood in the
    right sense by the official in question, and will be probably
    met by some such assurance as&mdash;"The train is very full,
    Madam, but I will do my best for the gentleman, and can ensure
    him, I think, a compartment to himself, at least, as far as
    Bolchester, where I leave the train. But I will explain the
    matter to my successor, and I have no doubt that he will be
    able (this also with a significant wink) to ensure the
    gentleman's seclusion. You are, I think, four? If you will
    follow me, and take my arm, Sir, I think we shall be able to
    manage it for you."</p>

    <p>3. Enlist the assistance of several attendant porters,
    regardless of apparent outlay, who have been fairly let into
    your secret, and are prepared to, and in fact absolutely do,
    empty a third-class compartment already packed with passengers
    for Barminster, who retreat awe-stricken at your approach.</p>

    <p>4. Immediately on taking possession of your carriage,
    recline the whole length of the five seats, faced by your three
    sympathetic and anxious-miened female companions. Be careful to
    give each of the assistant porters certainly not less than
    sixpence apiece in ostentatious fashion. Do not, however, as
    yet administer the shilling, or perhaps, eighteenpence you
    purpose giving to the original guard of the train who is to
    hand you over to the official who will have charge of you after
    Bolchester.</p>

    <p>5. You will possibly have a <i>mauvais quart d'heure</i>
    before departure, for though your guard, in hopes of the
    remunerative fee, will have carefully locked you in, he will
    not be able to prevent the calculating and more or less
    unfeeling British public, who, composed of a party of nine, are
    looking for as many places as they can find together, from
    discovering that you have six vacant places in your carriage,
    and directing the attention of other railway officials, not
    initiated into your secret agreement, to this circumstance. You
    must therefore be prepared for some such curt brutality as,
    "Why, look 'ere, EMMA, there's room for 'arf-a-dozen of us
    'ere!" or, "I'm sure 'e needn't be a sprawlin' like that,
    takin' 'arf the carriage to 'isself," a rebuke which your
    feminine supporters resent in their severest manner. You are,
    however, at length saved by the interposition of your guardian
    angel, who sweeps away the party of nine unseated ones with a
    voice of commanding control, as much as to say, "This isn't
    your end of the train; besides, can't you see the poor
    gentleman's pretty well dying?" And he does hurry them off, and
    pack them in somewhere or other, but whether to their
    satisfaction or not, it is easier to hazard a guess than
    faithfully to record.</p>

    <p>6. Bolchester is reached, and you are formally introduced to
    your final guarding and protecting angel, who rapidly takes in
    the situation, and by an assurance that he will see to your
    comfort, this, accompanied by a slightly perceptible wink,
    leaves you in happy expectation, which the result justifies, of
    reaching your destination uninvaded.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Time <i>I</i> had a look
    in, I think. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, Miss Trotter, what do you
    think of the Rhine, as far as you've got?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I guess it's navigable, as far as
    <i>I've</i> got.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> No, but I mean to say&mdash;does it come up to
    the mark in the scenery line, you know?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I cannot answer that till I know whereabouts
    it is they mark the scenery-line. I expect Mr. CULCHARD knows.
    He knows pretty well everything. Would you like to have him
    explain the scenery to you going along? His explanations are
    vurry improving, I assure you.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I daresay; but the scenery just here is so flat
    that even my friend's remarks won't improve it.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>producing his note-book
    ostentatiously</i>). I do not propose to attempt it. No doubt
    you will be more successful in entertaining Miss TROTTER than I
    can pretend to be. I retire in your favour. [<i>He
    scribbles.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Is that our expenses you're corking down there,
    CULCHARD, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). If you want to know, I
    am "corking down," to adopt your elegant expression, a sonnet
    that suggested itself to me.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Much better cork that <i>up</i>, old

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He glances at her for appreciation.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> That's so. I don't believe the poetic spirit
    has much chance of slopping over so long as Mr. PODBURY is
    around. You have considerable merit as a stopper, Mr.
    PODBURY.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I see; I'd better clear out till the poetry has
    all gurgled out of him, eh? Is that the idea?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> If it is, it's your own, so I guess it's a
    pretty good one.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[PODBURY <i>shoulders off.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with his pathetic stop on</i>). I wish I
    had more of your divine patience! Poor fellow, he is not
    without his good points; but I do find him a thorn in my flesh
    occasionally, I'm afraid.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I don't know as a thorn in the flesh is
    any the pleasanter for having a good point.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Profoundly true, indeed. I often think I could
    like him better if there were less in him to like. I assure you
    he tries me so at times that I could almost wish I was back at
    work in my department at Somerset House!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I daresay you have pretty good times there,
    too. Isn't that one of your leading dry goods stores?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>pained</i>). It is not; it is a Government
    Office, and I am in the Pigeonhole and Docket Department, with
    important duties to discharge. I hope you didn't imagine I sold
    ribbons and calico over a counter?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>ambiguously</i>). Well, I wasn't just
    sure. It takes a pretty bright man to do that where I come
    from.</p>

    <p><i>An Old Lady</i> (<i>who is sitting next to</i> PODBURY,
    <i>and reading a home-letter to another Old Lady</i>). "Dear
    MARIA and dear MADELINE are close by, they have taken very
    comfortable lodgings in Marine Crescent. Dear MADELINE's frame
    is expected down next Saturday."</p>

    <p><i>Second Old Lady</i>. MADELINE's frame! Is anything wrong
    with the poor girl's spine?</p>

    <p><i>First Old Lady</i>. I never heard of it. Oh, I see, it's
    <i>fiancé</i>, my dear. CAROLINE <i>does</i> write so
    illegibly. (<i>Continuing.</i>) "Um&mdash;um,&mdash;suppose you
    know she will be maimed&mdash;" (perhaps it <i>is</i> her spine
    after all&mdash;oh, <i>married</i>, to be sure), "very slowly"
    (is it slowly or shortly, I wonder?), um&mdash;um, "very quiet
    wedding, nobody but dear Mr. WILKINSON and his hatter."</p>

    <p><i>Second O.L.</i> The idea of choosing one's hatter for
    one's best man! I'm surprised MARIA should allow it!</p>

    <p><i>First O.L.</i> Maria always <i>was</i>
    peculiar&mdash;still, now I come to look, it's more like
    "brother," which is certainly <i>much</i> more suitable.
    (<i>Continuing.</i>) "She will have no&mdash;no bird's-marks
    ..." (Now, what <i>does</i> that&mdash;should you think that
    meant "crows-feet"? Oh, no, <i>how</i> stupid of
    me&mdash;<i>bridesmaids</i>, of course!)&mdash;"and will go to
    the otter a plain guy"&mdash;(Oh, Caroline really is
    <i>too</i>....)&mdash;"to the <i>altar</i> in plain
    <i>grey</i>! She has been given such quantities of
    pea-nuts"&mdash;(very odd things to give a girl! Oh,
    <i>presents</i>! um, um)&mdash;"Not settled yet where to go for
    their hangman"&mdash;(the officiating clergyman, I
    suppose&mdash;very flippant way of putting it, I <i>must</i>
    say! It's meant for <i>honeymoon</i>, though, I see, to be
    <i>sure</i>!) &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I should like to be at Nuremberg with you. It
    would be an unspeakable delight to watch the expansion of a
    fresh young soul in that rich mediæval atmosphere!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess you'll have opportunities of watching
    Mr. PODBURY's fresh young soul under those conditions, any
    way.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> It would not be at all the same
    thing&mdash;even if he&mdash;but you <i>do</i> think you're
    coming to Nuremberg, don't you?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, it's this way. Poppa don't want to get
    fooling around any more one-horse towns than he can help, and
    he's got to be fixed up with the idea that Nuremberg is a
    prominent European sight before he drops everything to get
    there.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I will undertake to interest him in Nuremberg.
    Fortunately, we are all getting off at Bingen, and going,
    curiously enough, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> to the same hotel. (<i>To
       himself</i>.) Confound that fellow PODBURY, here he is
       <i>again</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>to himself, as he advances</i>). If she's
    carrying on with that fellow, CULCHARD, to provoke me, I'll
    soon show her how little I&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) I say, old
    man, hope I'm not interrupting you, but I just want to speak to
    you for a minute, if Miss TROTTER will excuse us. Is there any
    particular point in going as far as Bingen to-night, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>resignedly</i>). As much as there is in
    not going farther than somewhere else, <i>I</i> should have
    thought.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Well, but look here&mdash;why not stop at
    Bacharach, and see what sort of a place it is?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You forget that our time is limited if we're
    going to stick to our original route.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Yes, of course; mustn't waste any on the Rhine.
    Suppose we push on to Maintz to-night, and get the Rhine off
    our hands then? (<i>With a glance at</i> Miss TROTTER.) The
    sooner I've done with this steamer business the better!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, Mr. PODBURY, that's not a vurry
    complimentary remark to make before me!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> We've seen so little of one another lately that
    it can hardly make much difference&mdash;to <i>either</i> of
    us&mdash;can it?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Now I call that real kind, you're consoling
    me in advance!</p>

    <p><i>The Steward</i> (<i>coming up</i>). De dickets dat I haf
    nod yed seen! (<i>examining</i> CULCHARD's <i>coupons</i>). For
    Bingen&mdash;so?</p>

    <p><i>Culch. I</i> am. This gentleman gets off&mdash;is it
    Bacharach or Maintz, PODBURY?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>sulkily</i>). Neither, as it happens. I'm
    for Bingen, too, as you won't go anywhere else. Though you
    <i>did</i> say when we started, that the advantage of
    travelling like this was that we could go on or stop just as
    the fancy took us!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>calmly</i>). I did, my dear PODBURY. But
    it never occurred to me that the fancy would take you to get
    tired of a place before you got there!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>as he walks forwards</i>). Hang that
    fellow! I know I shall punch his head some day. And She didn't
    seem to care whether I stayed or not. (<i>Hopefully.</i>) But
    you never <i>can</i> tell with women!</p>

    diffrent opinyons the men of other countries may find in regard
    to the warious customs and manners of our grate but rayther rum

    the least effeck on his good temper. It seems as he got
    interdooced to some sillybrated pusson who rites in papers and
    seemed to kno everythink, but wot he wanted to kno was if I
    coud tell him what caused his werry bad indijeshun, to which I
    at once replied, without a moment's hesitashun, that it was
    probberbly owing to his being, wich he told me he was, a sort

    old friend BILL the Fisherman, and there, he told me
    arterwards, he had sich a luvly day of it as he never rememberd
    having afore. He sat for fours ours in a luvly Punt, in a
    bewtifool drizzlin rain, with lots of fish a biting away, but
    he was much too much engaged to pay the least atenshun to 'em,
    and there wasn't not noboddy to bother him; so he sat there,
    and thort out about the most himportentest ewent of his life;
    and when I waited upon him at the "Grand Hotel" arterwards, I
    don't think as I ewer seed a reel Gent, as he suttenly is, in
    such jolly good sperrits. So, seeing how werry successfool I
    had been, I wentured to say to him,&mdash;"And now, Sir, if you
    wants to see gentlemanly Marlow in quite another aspic, and one
    that estonishes and delites all as sees it, just take the 9:45
    train from Paddington next Sunday, and, drectly you gets there,
    go at wunce to the Lock, and there, for ours and ours you will
    see sitch a sight of most ravishing bewty, combined with
    helegance and hart, as praps no other spot in all the hole
    world can show! Why, Sir," I said, "every time as the full Lock
    opens its yawning gates, at the command of one of the principel
    hofficers of the Tems Conserwancy, you will think of the Gates
    of Parrydice a hopening for a excurshun of hundreds of the most

    curosity, and I'll suttenly go, and," he added, with almost a
    blushing smile, "I rayther thinks as I'll take a companion with
    me."</p>

    <p>And off he went on the follering Sunday, and didn't git back
    till seven o'clock to dinner, and his fust words to me
    was,&mdash;"Mr. ROBERT, you didn't in the least xagerate the
    bewty of the scene as you sent me for to see&mdash;it was as
    strange and as lovely as a Faery Tail! I wasn't at all

    <h2>A CREDITABLE INCIDENT IN THE NEXT WAR.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>An Advance Sheet from Mr. Punch's Prophetic History of
    Europe.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>["Italy is bound to maintain abroad the appearance of a
        great and rich country, while at home she ought to conduct
        herself as if in straitened circumstances."&mdash;<i>Daily
        Paper</i>.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Italian Army had been completely victorious. There was
    but one drawback to the entire satisfaction of the
    Commander-in-Chief&mdash;one of his favourite Generals was
    under arrest, and was being tried by court-martial. The accused
    had refused the assistance of Counsel, and had insisted upon
    pleading "Guilty."</p>

    <p>"But," urged the Commander-in-Chief, "you surely have some
    excuse. To sack a private house belonging to your own
    countryman was unpardonable. It was an aimless piece of
    Vandalism! For your own reputation&mdash;for the sake of your
    ancestors&mdash;on behalf of your descendants&mdash;some
    explanation should be afforded."</p>

    <p>"Surely this is no time for levity," murmured a
    Warrior-Journalist, who was suspected of combining with the
    duties of a hero the labours of a Special Correspondent for a
    Roman journal.</p>

    <p>"Do I look like a jester?" asked the Prisoner; and then he
    added, "My brave companions, it is for the honour of our
    country&mdash;to conceal her poverty from the sneers of
    foreigners&mdash;that I carry with me the secret of my action
    to the family vault. Press me no further&mdash;see, I am ready
    for the firing-party!"</p>

    <p>There was nothing further to be said, and the little
    procession made its way to the Barrack Square. The Prisoner
    shook hands warmly with his Judges, and with the weeping
    soldiery who were to act as his executioners. "I will give the
    words of command myself. Ready&mdash;present&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Stop!"</p>

    <p>An aged man had approached the group. He was out of breath
    with running. The firing-party paused, and lowered their
    rifles.</p>

    <p>"Do not listen to him!" shouted the Accused. "And if he will
    not desist, shoot him too&mdash;shoot us both."</p>

    <p>"You exceed your duties, Sirrah," said the
    Commander-in-Chief, with some severity&mdash;for discipline was
    strict in the Italian Army. "It is for me to command, not you!"
    The Prisoner lowered his head at the just reproof, and then his
    superior officer continued, "Why do you ask us to desist?"</p>

    <p>"Because the Prisoner is innocent. He acted from the best of
    motives. I was the proprietor of the shop he sacked, and I
    (for, after all, I am a patriot) demand his pardon!"</p>

    <p>"You!" exclaimed the Commander-in-Chief. "Surely you ought
    to be the last to urge such a plea. We do not know what your
    shop contained, but presume that the contents was your
    property."</p>

    <p>"You are right in the presumption," acquiesced the aged man;
    "but these documents will show that he was right, from a
    military point of view, to sack my shop."</p>

    <p>The Commander-in-Chief hastily glanced at the papers, and
    with a thrill of pleasure, ordered his favourite General to be
    released.</p>

    <p>"This mystery must never be revealed," he murmured. And it
    never would, had not the hero-journalist printed the story.
    Thus it was that the tale became international property. Now it
    is known all the world over that the General sacked a shop to
    obtain the arms and accoutrements of the Italian Army. But it
    is still (comparatively) a secret that the proprietor of the
    establishment carried on on the premises the business of a
    pawnbroker!</p>

    <h2>SOLOMON PELL IN ALL HIS GLORY.</h2>

    <h3><i>A Dickensian Dream at Plymouth.</i></h3>

    <p>"Boy!" cried Mr. SOLOMON PELL, in the tones of a severe
    Stentor. The small Boy with the Big Blue Bag responded promptly
    with a deferential "Yussir."</p>

    <p>"Listen!" pursued Mr. PELL, with dignity. And he read with
    emphatic elocution from some closely-printed columns in the
    <i>Times</i>, interjecting exclamatory comments from time to
    time.</p>

    <div class="figright"

    <p>"'When we remember the importance of the work daily
    intrusted to Solicitors (<i>Important, indeed!</i>), and the
    amount of industry (<i>Quite so!</i>), judgment
    (<i>Exactly!</i>), learning (<i>I believe you!</i>), and
    integrity (<i>Why, cert'n'ly!</i>), it involves, and the
    responsibility which is necessarily incurred by them in
    advising, not only in public and political matters, but in all
    the details of private transactions, the dealings with
    property, and matters affecting not only the purses, but the
    honour and reputation (<i>Ah!!!</i>), of the members of the
    community (<i>Well, and pointedly put, Boy!</i>), and when we
    remember, in addition, what a powerful and (on the whole)
    respected body they are (<i>I should think so!</i>)&mdash;a
    body, too, consisting not merely of a "fortuitous concourse of
    atoms" (<i>I should say not, indeed! Fancy me being a mere
    "atom," or fortuitous!</i>) ("Please, Sir, I <i>can't</i>;"
    interjected the Boy with the Bag)&mdash;each going his own way,
    and seeking his own interest, but bound together, as the great
    bulk of its members are, and organised by means of this great
    Society, and of the kindred societies scattered over the
    country, and acting in harmony with it&mdash;it seems most
    surprising (<i>Surprising? Astounding, Sir!</i>) that so little
    in the way of dignity and reward can be looked forward to by
    the Solicitor, however honestly, ably, and conscientiously he
    may perform the arduous and responsible duties of his
    profession.'"</p>

    <p>Mr. PELL here paused, and panted, like one who comes to the
    surface after a deep-sea dive. Then he pursued:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"There, Boy! <i>That</i> is from the opening speech of the
    President of the Incorporated Law Society at Plymouth! And
    excellent it is,&mdash;though perhaps a little long-winded. As
    a mere sentence, a sinuous sequence of words, a 'breather' in
    syllables, an exercise in adjectives, it cuts the record and
    takes the cake. But look, Boy, at the sound common-sense of it!
    Since the famous, if flattering, remarks&mdash;concerning
    Me!&mdash;of my late friend, the ex-Lord-Chancellor, who
    said&mdash;nay, swore, that 'the country ought to be proud of
    me,' I have met with no observations concerning our Profession
    which so commend themselves to my judgment."</p>

    <p>"Oh, please Sir, yussir, right you are, Sir!" jerked out the
    Boy with the Bag.</p>

    <p>"Right Mr. MELMOTH WALTERS is," corrected Mr. PELL,
    severely. "I knew it would come, Boy, and it <i>has</i>. Though
    it has taken time, it has taken time. Listen yet further, and
    don't fidget with that Bag!</p>

    <p>"'I contend (<i>He contends!</i>) that it is the duty of the
    State to provide due recognition of merit in the ranks of a
    Profession which has been set apart (<i>Dedicated, as it were,
    like a&mdash;like a&mdash;sort of a scapegoat&mdash;ahem! no,
    not that, exactly, either, but&mdash;a&mdash;you know, Boy, you
    know!</i>), and regulated (<i>Just a leetle too much,
    perhaps</i>) by it, from which so much is expected, and to
    which so much is confided.'</p>

    <p>"Splendid! My sentiments to a touch! Sir, that Blue Bag is a
    Temple of Sacred Secrets, and <i>should</i> be a shrine of Open
    Honour. (<i>Must make a note of that for my next speech at the
    Forum!</i>) 'Sir SOLOMON PELL' would not sound badly, eh,
    Boy?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, please Sir, yussir&mdash;I mean, no, Sir, fur from it,
    Sir&mdash;<i>fur</i> from it!"</p>

    <p>"And yet the Bar gets all the honours, and most of the
    emoluments, whilst the Blue Bag, too often, is sent empty away.
    Is it just? Is it judicious? What says once again the Plymouth
    oracle?</p>

    <p>"'I ask whether it is wise or prudent on the part of the
    State to leave unnoticed and disregarded the higher aspirations
    and ambitions of a large and useful and powerful class of the
    community?'</p>

    <p>"No, Sir&mdash;a thousand times no! Let our 'higher
    aspirations' be considered. <i>Some</i> of us have souls above
    six-and-eightpence, and yearnings beyond bills of costs. Let
    'em be gratified, Boy!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, please Sir, yussir: let 'em! Immediately&mdash;if not
    sooner, Sir!"</p>

    <p>"<i>By</i> the State&mdash;with a capital S! If a soldier
    may carry a Field Marshal's <i>bâton</i> in his knapsack, why,
    <i>why</i> should not a Solicitor carry a Baronetcy in his Blue
    Bag?"</p>

    <p>"And Ekker answers, 'Why?' Sir."</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon, Boy, it is the <i>Times</i>, not the
    <i>Echo</i>, which so answers. The <i>Times</i>
    says:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"'They (Solicitors) are the guardians of our dearest (yes,
    our <i>dearest</i>) interests, the confidants of family
    secrets, the arbiters in family controversies, and not
    infrequently the custodians of the honour and the good name of
    their clients.'</p>

    <p>"Quite so. Why, Boy, did we let out the Secrets of the Blue
    Bag, the contents of Old Nick's Sack, which that 'stupid old
    snuff-colour'd son of a gun,' Saint Medard 'cut into slits on
    the Red Sea shore' would be <i>nothing</i> to 'em!"</p>

    <p>"Nothink at all, Sir; nothink, wotsomedever!"</p>

    <p>"No matter&mdash;a time will come, Boy! In Mr. WILLIAM
    MELMOTH WALTERS's speech I see the dawn of it.</p>

    <p>"'The Profession, it is true, does not receive in any great
    measure those official dignities and rewards which the
    President claims on its behalf, nor are we quite confident
    that, if it did, the fact would increase the confidence or the
    respect of its clients.'</p>

    <p>"Well, the <i>Times</i> may not be 'quite confident.'
    <i>I</i> am! And so would the clients be, I'm sure. Remove that
    Blue Bag, Boy! Wonder what <i>Mr. Pickwick's</i> opinion of Mr.
    WALTERS's speech would have been, and that of the
    <i>Wellers</i>, father and son! [<i>Sings.</i></p>

    <p>The boy had gone out to get change.</p>

    <p>I was waiting in the studio, listening to the photographer.
    He was in quite a small way of business, and no one would have
    expected him to have any change for anything. I was sitting on
    a rustic stile, with a Greek temple and some wilted Spiræas in
    the background. He was in the dark room, busy, splashing
    liquids about, and reminiscent. I still believe that he thought
    the time of waiting would seem shorter to me if he talked. The
    whole place seemed to suggest financial difficulties, and smelt
    of chemicals.</p>

    <p>"You remember the Punyer case?" he asked. His voice sounded
    thin and far-off through the closed door of the dark room.</p>

    <p>I did. PUNYER had been a cashier, and had absconded with
    rather more than the usual amount.</p>

    <p>"Well, I had some dealings with PUNYER. As a cashier he was
    certainly dishonest, but as a man he was absolutely reliable,
    and nothing would induce him to break his word. I know that to
    be a fact from my personal experience of the man; indeed, it
    was through me that he was identified&mdash;or, rather, through
    one of my photographs."</p>

    <p>"Really?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. On the day that he absconded, a four-wheeler drove up
    to this house. The driver got off, and sent a message up to the
    studio that a gentleman in a cab outside wished to speak to me.
    So, of course, I went out. Inside the cab I found a man wearing
    a thick green veil. He explained to me that his face had been
    injured in a railway accident, and that he could not allow it
    to be seen by any one. He wanted me to photograph the back of
    his head. He knew that the request was unusual. 'But,' he said,
    pathetically, 'my few friends have got to know the back of my
    head, just as they know the faces of others who are&mdash;who
    are less unfortunate than myself. The doctors tell me that I
    have not long to live, and my friends are eager to have some
    slight memento of me.' I was much moved, and I agreed to
    photograph him at once."</p>

    <p>"The man was PUNYER?"</p>

    <p>"Of course. The photograph of the back of his head turned
    out admirably&mdash;clear and full of character."</p>

    <p>"But why did he get photographed at all?"</p>

    <p>"You shall hear; it all came out afterwards. I have already
    told you that PUNYER, in his private capacity, was a man of his
    word. It appears that he was engaged to a Miss MIRANDA BUDE.
    Indeed, it was to her that I was to send the photographs when
    they were finished. He had promised her that he would have his
    photograph taken for her on his birthday; and the day on which
    he absconded happened to be his birthday. He could not break
    his promise. What was he to do? At first he disguised himself
    as far as he could; he shaved off his luxurious beard and
    moustache; he had his long fair hair closely cropped and
    stained black. But there was on his face one certain mark of
    identification which he could not alter nor remove. It was a
    slight scar, extending diagonally across his forehead; when he
    was a child he once fell into the fender, and the mark had
    remained ever since. At last the bright idea occurred to him
    that he might have the back of his head photographed instead of
    his face, and so keep his promise to MIRANDA. It was really a
    brilliant idea. For there was absolutely nothing in the view of
    the back of his head by which he <i>could</i> be
    identified."</p>

    <p>"But you told me just now that he actually <i>was</i>
    identified by your photograph."</p>

    <p>"So he was;&mdash;I was just going to explain. I was sitting
    in my studio one day, touching up the photographs of the
    back-view of PUNYER, when in came a detective from Scotland
    Yard. From his appearance, a detective was the last thing on
    earth that you would have taken him to be."</p>

    <p>"They generally say that in the detective stories," I said,
    meditatively.</p>

    <p>"If you think I'm making this up&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No, no,&mdash;not at all. Go on."</p>

    <p>"Well, he told me his business, and I at once showed him one
    of the photographs, telling him under what circumstances they
    were taken. He examined it carefully. 'Ah!' he said, 'if I only
    could prove that this was PUNYER, I should be able to complete
    my case, and my advancement would be certain. In my own mind I
    am convinced of it, but at present I cannot prove it. PUNYER
    had a scar on his face. It was like his devilish cunning to
    have only the back of his head photographed!' He was just
    leaving, when suddenly a new idea seemed to flash across him.
    He seized the photograph, and rushed across to the mirror. You
    know that if anything is written backwards, you can read it by
    holding it up to a looking-glass. So, of course, the detective,
    by holding up the photograph of the back-view, saw the
    full-face reflected. The scar showed just above the green veil,
    and consequently&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At this point the boy returned with my change. The
    photographer had locked himself into the dark room, and I could
    not get at him; the law gives a man no redress under such
    circumstances, and so I came away.</p>

    <p>I might have got over the story, perhaps; but my change, I
    found afterwards, was sixpence short, and that is not so easy
    to forgive.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
